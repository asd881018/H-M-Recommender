# H-M-Recommender

## Project Scope
This project is about machine learning models were explored to solve the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations problem on the Kaggle data science competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/overview) for SFU CMPT310 class project. Transaction history, customer and article metadata, as well as article image data was provided for this competition, but a simplified dataset based on the available data was used for the purposes of this project. The models tested include Markov Process, Term-Frequency, and a custom algorithm that ranked weekly trends. Ensemble models of these algorithms were also tested. The maximum prediction rate across all models was 13%, achieved by the weekly trends algorithm and all ensemble models. An inverse correlation between model complexity and prediction performance was observed for this dataset, though a different distribution of performance ranking is suspected for larger datasets. Demographic and seasonal factors are highly impactful factors to account for, and a customerâ€™s recent purchases can be used to infer immediate or future purchases
in recommendation systems.
